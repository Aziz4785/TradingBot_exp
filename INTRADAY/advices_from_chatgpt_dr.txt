Monitor Feature Importance: Continuously monitor which features the model relies on 
(e.g. feature importance in Random Forest/XGBoost). 
If the model’s top features shift dramatically day-to-day or include many low-importance ones, 
it may be overfitting. Focus on a stable set of features that consistently add value, 
and eliminate those that don’t. This streamlining makes the model more robust in live trading.


A longer test horizon increases the chance of catching different regimes 
and reduces overfitting to any single period​

 Another best practice is cross-validation tailored for time series (such as purged walk-forward cross-validation) 
 to produce multiple out-of-sample evaluations
